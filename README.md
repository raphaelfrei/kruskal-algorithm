# Kruskal Algorithm - Minimum Spanning Tree
**Details:** Kruskal Algorithm in C# and Portugol for College Activity.<br>
**Subject:** Graph Theory.

The PDF attached is my handwritten guide about MST.

All codes commentaries are in PT-BR

## Pre-Requistes:
- Study about the Kruskal Algorithm;
- Create a Pseudo-Code; *(I choose to create in Portugol - A PT-BR Pseudo-Code Language)*
- Implement the Code in C Language;

## How To Use:

### Inputs:
**1st input:** The edge quantity in the graph - You don't need to put the vertices; *(Min. of 5 and Max. of 15)*<br>
**2nd input:** Loop between 0 and the quantity you inserted;<br>

### Outputs:
**1st output:** The new edges - After removing Cicles and Paralels;<br>
**2nd output:** Details of the operation - More for testing purposes like which edges the program took off;<br>
**3rd output:** Final graph node;<br>
**4th output:** Minimal Cost;<br>

## Known-Bugs:
V1.0 - No Cycle Break;<br>
V1.1 - Issue on Cycles with more than 3 connections;<br>
V1.2 - Glitches with a few cases *(Mostly on connections between the last and the first node)*;<br>
